# Topbar

The topbar widget can be included at the top of a web page to provide:

* Links to central websites (BMM, Brunstad TV, YEP…)
* Links to local churches
* Show personalized information of the user (e.g. display the name of the user)
* Logout function

## Install the topbar

**WordPress applications that have the ``BCC Signon`` plugin installed should not follow this tutorial (the topbar is
already included in the plugin).**

Make sure you include this styling in your ``head`` tag:



Inside of the data-app-title attribute you can add the title of the application and in data-app-url, the url of the
website you want to point to. That can, for example, be:

``data-app-title="BCC Developer" data-app-url="https://developer.bcc.no"``

## Configuration:

Please check the [widgets authentication](https://developer.bcc.no/products/bcc-widgets/widget-authentication).
