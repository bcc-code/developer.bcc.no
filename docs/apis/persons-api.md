::: warning DEPRECATED
The persons API is deprecated in favor of the Core API [see here](https://developer.bcc.no/bcc-core-api/)
:::

# Persons API

This API is the official source of personal data for Machine-To-Machine applications in BCC. If you're creating a third party application, you will need to get user's consent in order to get access to their data

## Getting Started

### Use an SDK if available
You can find available SDKs [here](#sdks)

### Get an access token
The process is described in [APIs page](./index.md).

### Use the token to get data from the API

#### Example in cURL
```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url $API_ORIGIN/persons/1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN' \
```

#### Example response
```json
{
    "data":{
        "age":30,
        "birthDate":"1990-01-01",
        "displayName":"John Doe",
        "firstName":"John",
        "lastChangedDate":"2019-12-09T00:18:18.615Z",
        "lastName":"Doe",
        "middleName":"",
        "personID":1
    }
}
```
