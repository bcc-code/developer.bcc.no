The BCC IT Community is a place for *anybody* within BCC who is interested in IT and digital product development.

## How to Join

Complete the [BCC IT Community Survey](https://forms.office.com/e/pPUB75XVfc) for 2023!  
Participants will go into a raffle to win one of 5 BCC IT Community mugs ;-) 

### [2. Join Discord](https://developer.bcc.no/discord/)

Join the BCC IT Community [Discord server](https://developer.bcc.no/discord/). Discord is the main tool we use for text and voice communication as well as posting information about projects and events. Discord will _replace_ the existing Slack channels for BCC Developers.

### [3. Check out Github](https://github.com/bcc-code)

Check out open source projects in the [bcc-code](https://github.com/bcc-code) organization in [Github](https://github.com/bcc-code). We use Github for source control, CI/CD and project and issue management.

## Volunteering

We are always looking for volunteers to help us out with BCC projects. If you are interested in helping out, stay tuned on Discord.
