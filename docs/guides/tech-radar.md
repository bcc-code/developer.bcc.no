# BCC Technology Radar

<TechRadar />

## What Is This?

As new technologies are introduced in the BCC IT community, they move from the outside status rings towards the middle.
These are our commitments and expectations for each ring:

* **adopt** - We're considering the technology "standard", recommend using it and can provide good support for it.
* **trial** - We're trying the technology and will perhaps adopt it.
* **assess** - We're keeping an eye on the technology for potential use in the future, but do not recommend using it yet.
* **hold** - We have not had a good experience with the technology or it doesn't align with our strategy. We recommend phasing it out.

If anything is not on the radar it means that we have never considered it seriously.

## How To Add

Edit [tech-radar.js](/.vuepress/components/tech-radar.js) and add your technology to the `technologies` array.
You'll have to pick a category (frameworks, languages, tools, platform, techniques) and a status (hold, assess, trial, adopt).
