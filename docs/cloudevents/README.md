# CloudEvents

This repository contains types for [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io) issued by BCC.

The "source of truth" for the event data format is in the form of [Google Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

See [proto/README.md](https://github.com/bcc-code/bcc-code.github.io/tree/master/docs/cloudevents/proto/README.md) for more information about the messages used to describe CloudEvents.

# Cloud PubSub
Since most of our application are hosted in Google we use Cloud PubSub for publishing and subscribing cloud events.

## Naming conventions

### Topic
`[service]-topic` (e.g. contribution-topic, membership-topic, event-topic)

### Subscription
`[publishing service]-[subscrybent service]-sub` (e.g. membership-contribution-sub, membership-event-sub)

A subscription needs to be unique per PubSub.
