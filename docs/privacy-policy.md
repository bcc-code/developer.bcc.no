By person is meant a living identified or identifiable natural person.  

Personal information means information and assessments that can be linked to you as a person. Examples can be name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, IP address, car license number, photos, date of birth and social security number. Information about behavior patterns is also considered personal information. This can be, for example, information about what TV series you are watching and where you are. Information about you that informs about your racial or ethnic background, about your political, philosophical or religious beliefs, health conditions, sexual relationships, and any information that you have been suspected, charged, indicted or convicted of a criminal offense, as well as union membership, is defined as sensitive personal information.  

By processing of personal data is meant all operations performed with personal data, such as collection, registration, structuring, storage and dissemination.  

By data controller is meant the company that is responsible for the processing of personal data, determines the purpose of the processing, and which instruments are to be used.  

Personal data shall only be processed for specific, explicit, stated and legitimate purposes.  

A data processor is a company that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller.  

A data processor agreement is an agreement between the data processor and the data controller on how personal data is to be processed.  

By basis of processing is meant the statutory basis for the processing of personal data. BCC IT uses one of these treatment bases:  

1. the registered person has consented to the processing, cf. the Privacy Ordinance art. 6 (1) (a)
2. it intends to fulfill an agreement to which the data subject is a party, cf. the Privacy Ordinance art. 6 No. 1 b)
3. it is necessary for purposes related to the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or a third party, unless the data subject’s interests or fundamental freedoms take precedence and require the protection of personal data, cf. the Privacy Ordinance art. 6 No. 1 f)
